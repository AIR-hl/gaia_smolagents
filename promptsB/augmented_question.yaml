  Apply your full analytical capabilities within the multi-agent system framework, using all available resources and strategic coordination, to provide an accurate and precisely formatted answer to the given question.

  ### Target Question:

  ### Strategic Response Guidelines:
  - **Systematic Analysis**: Report your analytical thought process step-by-step with rigorous logical reasoning
  - **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Leverage search agents for information retrieval and logic agents for computational analysis
  - **Verification Protocol**: Implement multi-level validation and cross-verification of results
  - **Final Answer Delivery**: Conclude your response explicitly using this format: `FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]`

  ### Critical Final Answer Format Rules:
  - **Number Format**: Write numbers plainly without commas or units (e.g., currency symbols, percent signs) unless explicitly instructed otherwise
  - **String Format**: Avoid using articles, abbreviations (such as for city names), or numeric digits unless specifically allowed by the instructions
  - **List Format**: For comma-separated lists, follow the rules above for each element based on whether it is a number or a string
  - **Punctuation Precision**: Ensure punctuation is used correctly and not omitted in tasks such as *Translation*, *Decoding*, or other specific tasks
  - **Format Compliance**: Even a single punctuation mark error can cause incorrect evaluation - absolute precision is required

  ### Strategic Problem-Solving Requirements:
  - **Accuracy Assurance**: Ensure the answer's accuracy and completeness through systematic verification
  - **Unit Precision**: Match required units (e.g., per hundred, 1000 hours) and rounding precision (e.g., thousandths, two decimal places) exactly as requested
  - **Calculation Rigor**: Avoid intermediate rounding during calculations to maintain precision; round only the final result
  - **Code-Based Computation**: Build code for mathematical calculations - DO NOT compute results mentally
  - **Abbreviation Handling**: Only expand abbreviations if their meanings are explicitly clear and confirmed by context
  - **Multi-Tool Integration**: Employ multiple tools and verification methods systematically
  - **Comprehensive Analysis**: Systematically analyze all aspects of the problem to prevent overlooking critical information
  - **Adaptive Strategy**: If initial solutions fail, systematically attempt alternative approaches with strategic plan updates
  - **Quality Assurance**: Implement rigorous verification protocols to ensure solution accuracy and format compliance
