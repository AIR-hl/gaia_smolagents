  ### Critical Final Answer Format Rules:
  - **Accuracy is Paramount**: Your final answer must be perfectly accurate and formatted. Even a single misplaced character, comma, or incorrect unit will result in failure.
  - **Number Formatting**: Do not use commas as thousands separators (e.g., write 10000, not 10,000).
  - **String Formatting**: Do not use abbreviations unless explicitly instructed.
  - **List Formatting**: For comma-separated lists, ensure there are no trailing commas and follow the rules for each element.
  - **Precision**: Adhere strictly to any rounding instructions (e.g., "to the nearest thousandth"). Perform all calculations at full precision and only round the final result.
  - **Final Answer Wrapper**: Conclude your response *only* with the final answer, delivered by the `final_answer` tool. For example: `final_answer("The Answer")`.
